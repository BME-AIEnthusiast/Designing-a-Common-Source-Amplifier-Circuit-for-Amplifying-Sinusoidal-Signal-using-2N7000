## Introduction
This project is part of the Electronic Devices course at the International University, School of Biomedical Engineering. The goal is to design a common source amplifier circuit to amplify a sinusoidal signal with a peak-to-peak voltage of 10mV and read the amplified signal using an Arduino microcontroller. This project enhances practical skills in circuit design, simulation, and real-world implementation, which are crucial in biomedical engineering for developing diagnostic and therapeutic devices.

## Materials & Methods
### Materials
- **2N7000**: Acts as the main amplifying component in the common-source amplifier circuit.
- **Resistors (2.2kΩ, 3.9kΩ, 10kΩ)**: Used for biasing the MOSFET and setting the operating point of the amplifier circuit.
- **Capacitors (10µF, 100µF)**: Function as coupling and decoupling capacitors to allow only the AC component of the input signal to pass through while blocking the DC component.
- **Fiberglass PCB**: Provides a foundation for surface-mounted electronic components.
- **Arduino Uno R3**: Used to read the output signal of the circuit.
- **Oscilloscope**: Provides tools to measure and analyze waveforms.
- **Voltage Supply**: Provides stable voltage to electronic devices or circuits.
- **Waveform Generator**: Used to generate electronic signals with 10mV sine waveforms.

### Software Tools
- **LTspice**: Used for electronic circuit simulation to save time and resources by refining electronic designs before physical construction.
- **Arduino IDE**: Used to program and load programs onto Arduino boards and to edit and operate the code program for the project.
